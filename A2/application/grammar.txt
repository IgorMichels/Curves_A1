additive ::= additive + multiplicative
           | additive - multiplicative
           | multiplicative

multiplicative ::= multiplicative * unary
                 | multiplicative exponential
                 | multiplicative / unary
                 |unary

unary ::= +unary
        | -unary
        | exponential

exponential ::= factor ^ exponential
              | factor

factor ::= number
         | constant
         | ( additive )
